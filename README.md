# Fourier
**Fourier** is a golfing language created by [Stack Exchange user Beta Decay], with similarities to Brainfuck, but more advanced. It is still undergoing development as of August 2015.

Syntax
------

### Repeat

`x()`

Repeat the code within the brackets until the accumulator equals the value of the accumulator at `x`. After the open bracket, the accumulator is set to 0. Repeats *can* be nested.

### If

`x{a}{b}`

If the result of `a` equals the value of the accumulator at `x` then run code `b`. After the open curly bracket, the accumulator is set to 0. Ifs *cannot* be nested.

### Increase

`^`

Increase the accumulator by one.

### Decrease

`v`

Decrease the accumulator by one.

### Number

`n`

Set the accumulator to the integer `n`.

### Character out

`a`

Takes the value of the accumulator as the ASCII code and outputs the character.

### Number out

`o`

Outputs the value of the accumulator.

### Random

`r`

Sets the accumulator to a random value in the range 0 to the value of the accumulator.

### Set variable

`~z`

Creates a variable `z` and sets it to value of the accumulator.

### Call variable

`z`

Sets the accumulator to the value of variable `z`. If not previously initialised, the variable is equal to 0.

### Add

`+x`

Sets the accumulator to the value of the accumulator plus the value of `x`.

### Subtract

`-x`

Sets the accumulator to the value of the accumulator minus the value of `x`.

### Multiply

`*x`

Sets the accumulator to the value of the accumulator multiplied by the value of `x`.

### Divide

`/x`

Sets the accumulator to the value of the accumulator divided by the value of `x`.

### Modulo

`%x`

Sets the accumulator to the remainder of the value of the accumulator divided by the value of `x`.

### Input

`I`

Sets the accumulator to the user input.

### Greater than

`>x`

Sets the accumulator to 1 if the value of the accumulator is greater than the value of `x`, 0 if not.

### Less than

<code><x</code>

Sets the accumulator to 1 if the value of the accumulator is less than the value of `x`, 0 if not.

### Equal to

`=x`

Sets the accumulator to 1 if the value of the accumulator is equal to the value of `x`, 0 if not.

### Date

`xd`

Sets the accumulator to parts of the date depending on the value of `x`:

#### 0d

Sets the accumulator to the seconds part of the current time.

#### 1d

Sets the accumulator to the minutes part of the current time.

#### 2d

Sets the accumulator to the hour part of the current time.

#### 3d

Sets the accumulator to the day part of the current date.

#### 4d

Sets the accumulator to the month part of the current date.

#### 5d

Sets the accumulator to the year part of the current date.

#### Other

If the date is any other number (apart from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), the accumulator is set to the current UNIX timestamp.

### CLS

`@`

Clears the current output.

### Delay

`x;`

Starts a time delay of `x` seconds, during which, no code is executed.
